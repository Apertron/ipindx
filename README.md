# Conventions

- Each IP is located under the `IPs` directory with the naming scheme `IP.{cson,md}` where `cson` is the machine readable information of the IP (using CSON, which compiles to JSON), and `md` is a detailed description of the IP.


# Automation

I hope to automate this in the near future.
